Self-taught programmer in everything javascript and typescript. Strong analytical thinker with good communication and interpersonal skills. I prefer top-down holistic thinking and communication as it allows me to truly understand what the end-user needs and why.

I love helping and seeing other people grow but also get a kick out of spending 8 hours straight in my editor. Exploring and creating ideas and code, from frontend to philosophy, is my passion. Independent and self driven but with strong people and team skills.
